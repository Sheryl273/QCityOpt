# üö¶ Quantum Optimization for Traffic Routing in Smart Cities Using QAOA

**QCityOpt** ‚Äì *Leveraging Quantum Optimization for Smarter Urban Mobility*

A Python-based framework that applies the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** to optimize traffic routing in smart cities using **IBM Qiskit**.

---

## üìò Abstract
Urban congestion is a growing challenge as traffic volumes increase.  
Traditional routing algorithms (Dijkstra, A*) often struggle to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions.  
This project demonstrates how **QAOA** can efficiently discover near-optimal routing paths by modeling the traffic network as a weighted graph.
