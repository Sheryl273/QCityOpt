# QCityOpt
“Leveraging Quantum Optimization for Smarter Urban Mobility.”
QCityOpt is a research project that applies the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using IBM Qiskit for optimizing smart-city traffic routing. The framework models urban road networks as weighted graphs and explores quantum optimization strategies to minimize congestion, travel time, and energy consumption.
